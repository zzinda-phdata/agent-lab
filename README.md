This repository contains a notebook we will be running after a short introductory lesson on agents.

To run this notebook, please ensure you have a python environment set-up locally. If you normally use Conda, there is an `environment.yml` file. If you use virtual environments, there is a `requirements.txt`file. You will also need a Tavily API key. These are free and do not require a credit card for <1000 queries per month. Zac will provide you with a key for using Azure OpenAI.
